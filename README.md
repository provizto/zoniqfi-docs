# ⚡ ZoniqFi Protocol — Technical Architecture & Protocol Specification

Welcome to the official technical documentation and architecture repository for **ZoniqFi Protocol**.

ZoniqFi is an institutional-grade, modular DeFi infrastructure protocol architected natively for the Solana blockchain. Built with Anchor/Rust and leveraging **Solana Transaction v1 (4,096-byte atomic payload)**, the protocol integrates **Jito Block Engine private bundle routing (Anti-MEV)**, an autonomous **USDC single-asset Yield Optimizer**, a deflationary **$ZQI Real Yield Lock**, and an **SNS-integrated Tiered On-Chain Referral Engine**.

## 🏛️ Core Protocol Architecture & Fee Routing

ZoniqFi resolves toxic MEV extraction (sandwich/front-running attacks) and token emission inflation through an atomic, fee-capitalized economic flywheel.

## 🚀 The 4 Core DeFi Infrastructure Modules

### 1. AMM DEX Swap Engine (Anti-MEV Atomic Execution)
* **Solana Transaction v1 (Versioned Tx):** Packs complex verification, swap routing, and multi-vault distributions into a single 4,096-byte atomic payload.
* **Jito Block Engine Private Bundles:** Routes transactions directly to validators, completely bypassing the public mempool to eliminate front-running and sandwich bots.
* **Anti-Wash Trading Protection:** Programmatic on-chain cooldown limits prevent artificial volume inflation.
* **0.3% Flat Protocol Fee:** Split atomically across Yield Vaults (40%), $ZQI Real Yield Pool (30%), Affiliate Treasury (15%), and Project Operations (15%).

### 2. Yield Optimizer Vault (Automated Compounding)
* **Single-Deposit USDC Liquidity:** Eliminates impermanent loss risk through deterministic single-asset staking strategies.
* **Autonomous Execution:** Periodically executes auto-compounding cycles via non-custodial smart contracts without requiring user-side gas expenditure.
* **Deterministic Yield Engine:** Baseline programmatic daily rate of 0.11% with boosted optimizations reaching up to **49.1% APY**.

### 3. $ZQI Lock & Real Yield (Deflationary Supply Defense)
* **0% Inflation Real Yield:** Staking rewards are distributed strictly in stable **USDC** derived from protocol swap fees, avoiding secondary market sell pressure from token emissions.
* **Lock Multipliers & Reward Weights:**
  * **30-Day Horizon:** 1.0x Reward Multiplier
  * **90-Day Horizon:** 1.5x Reward Multiplier
  * **180-Day Horizon:** 2.5x Reward Multiplier
* **Deflationary Burn Defense:** Premature emergency unlocks trigger a mandatory **10% penalty burned permanently on-chain**.

### 4. Secure On-Chain Affiliate (SNS-Integrated Referral)
* **Solana Name Service Support:** Natively resolves human-readable domain identities (.sol / .sns) alongside raw Public Keys.
* **Anti-Sybil Cooldown Engine:** Enforces a strict rate limit (1 transaction per 10 seconds) to prevent multi-wallet bot manipulation.
* **3-Tier Volume Rebates:**
  * **Bronze Tier ($0 – $10,000 Volume):** 10% Commission Rebate
  * **Silver Tier ($10,001 – $100,000 Volume):** 18% Commission Rebate
  * **Gold Tier (> $100,000 Volume):** 25% Commission Rebate

## 🔄 Self-Sustaining Economic Flywheel

1. **Traffic & Referral Inflow:** The On-Chain Affiliate engine incentivizes creators, referrers, and merchants to drive swap volume into the protocol.
2. **Fee Capitalization:** Every transaction charges a 0.3% fee collected directly as stable USDC revenue, completely bypassing token inflation.
3. **Supply Lock & Deflation:** Users lock $ZQI to capture 30% of protocol fees in USDC dividends. Early exits trigger a 10% burn, permanently reducing circulating supply.
4. **Compounding Liquidity:** 40% of swap fees feed the Yield Vault, continuously boosting APY and protocol-locked TVL.
