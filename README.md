# Provizto Protocol ($VZT)

Next-generation Decentralized Asset Management and Liquidity Optimization Protocol custom-engineered for the Solana Blockchain. Provizto introduces a mathematically driven, non-inflationary ecosystem backed by **Real Yield** revenue distribution, multi-asset private routing, and algorithmic supply deflation controls.

## 🚀 Core Functional Architecture

### 1. Multi-Asset AMM DEX Swap
* **Single-Gateway Tokenomics:** To generate sustained buying pressure and token velocity, the protocol enforces a single-destination routing matrix. All incoming liquidity assets (**USDC, USDT, SOL, WSOL**) trade exclusively directly into **$VZT** (and vice-versa from $VZT to USDC) backed by simulated automated smart-contract conversion at the ledger level.
* **Private Jito Routing Engine:** Transactions are securely routed via private Jito validator bundles, providing complete immunity against predatory MEV front-running and front-row sandwich exploits.
* **Anti-Wash Trading Constraints:** On-chain ledger filters run daily protocol loops to track, detect, and mitigate inorganic volume inflation anomalies.

### 2. Automated Yield Optimizer Vaults
* **Agnostic Cross-Protocol Aggregation:** User-deposited USDC is programmatically deployed into top-tier Solana yield instruments (e.g., Kamino, Meteora, Marginfi) via non-custodial smart contracts, organically scaling the Protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL).
* **Compounding Mechanics:** Operates on a target interest metric of **0.11% daily**, which mathematically compounds to a **Boosted APY of up to 49.1% annually** ($APY = (1 + 0.0011)^{365} - 1$).
* **Fee Underwriting Security:** The yield engine stability is fundamentally insulated from market volatility as it is constantly backstopped by **40% of all global swap fees** collected by the platform.

### 3. VZT Programmed Lock Pool (Real Yield Engine)
* **Non-Inflationary Incentives:** Provizto rejects traditional inflationary token minting rewards. Stakers who lock $VZT are rewarded exclusively in **stable USDC**, derived directly from real platform transaction utility.
* **Dual Interface Multipliers:** Stakers can optimize their processing scores through two distinct cryptographic modes:
  * **Instant Lock:** Manual entry allocation with a 1.0x Base Processing Weight.
  * **Boosted Lock (Escrow Bonds):** Time-locked horizons featuring explicit reward multipliers:
    * *30-Day Horizon:* 1.0x Base Multiplier.
    * *90-Day Horizon:* 1.5x Boosted Multiplier Weight.
    * *180-Day Horizon:* 2.5x Maximum Multiplier Weight.
* **Strict 7-Day Epoch Horizon:** Reward allocations accumulate over an immutable **7-day cycle (`604,800,000 ms`) time-lock parameter**. This rigorous network constraint completely neutralizes high-frequency flash-loan vectors and guarantees liquidity layer stabilization.

## 📊 Tokenomics & Strategic Fee Allocation Matrix

Every transaction executed on the Provizto AMM Swap module triggers a baseline **0.3% Protocol Fee** that is programmatically partitioned at the smart contract ledger level:

| Target Vault Destination | Fee Split Allocation | Operational Objective |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Yield Optimizer Underwriting** | **40%** | Backstops the 49.1% APY auto-compounding reserves. |
| **VZT Real Yield Pool** | **30%** | Converted to stable USDC to pay out locked $VZT stakers. |
| **Affiliate Treasury** | **15%** | Finances multi-tiered on-chain partner rewards. |
| **Dev & Infrastructure Treasury** | **15%** | Funds network RPC nodes, security audits, and developer upkeep. |

### 👑 Capital Grant Clawback & Repayment Clause
To ensure institutional financial transparency with our grant providers, the **15% Dev & Infrastructure Treasury** features a built-in automated debt-repayment clawback routing rule:
* **20% Outflow Split:** Every distribution routed into the Dev Treasury automatically splits **20% of its allocation** to fulfill strategic grant repayment schedules directly into the grantor's monitored address.
* This architecture proves a sustainable payback model without ever liquidating or diluting the native $VZT market supply.

## 🛡️ Sybil-Resistant Affiliate Framework

Provizto features a performance-based, on-chain referral module designed with strict cryptographic guardrails to completely eliminate loop-exploits:
* **Anti-Sybil Constraints:** The smart contract registry explicitly blocks self-referrals (`SelfReferralNotAllowed` exception) and enforces a mandatory **10-second transaction cooldown timeout** per account path.
* **Dynamic Reward Tier Metrics:** Commissions scale fluidly based on the cumulative on-chain volume verified from the referred network path:
  * **Bronze Tier ($0 - $10,000 Volume):** Receives a **10%** commission rate.
  * **Silver Tier ($10,001 - $100,000 Volume):** Upgraded to an **18%** commission rate.
  * **Gold Tier (> $100,000 Volume):** Grants a premium VIP **25%** commission rate.

## 🔥 Emergency Hard-Stop Protocol (Deflationary Burn)

If a market participant initiates a premature unlock of capital assets from a Lock contract prior to the designated computational maturity date, the contract triggers the **Emergency Liquidation Clause**:
1. **20% Principal Penalty:** A mandatory 20% of the locked token principal is instantly deducted based on the `EMERGENCY_BURN_PENALTY_RATE` constraint.
2. **Permanent Burn Destruction:** The 20% penalty is immediately and irreversibly dispatched to the verified Solana native dead address (`11111111111111111111111111111111`), permanently removing it from the total circulating supply.
3. **Supply Shock Shadows:** This mechanism protects the liquidity layer from sudden panic-withdrawals while inducing a healthy systemic token scarcity that fundamentally benefits long-term $VZT network holding entities.
