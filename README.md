# ⚡ ZoniqFi Hub — Premium Solana White-Label dApp Infrastructure

Welcome to the official technical specification and deployment portal for the **ZoniqFi Hub**. This premium, turnkey dApp infrastructure is engineered specifically for the Solana blockchain. Built using React, Vite, and fully integrated with the **Jupiter Price API v2** and **Jito MEV-Protection Engine**, this repository provides a high-performing utility suite for project owners and token creators looking to supercharge holder retention, accelerate trading volume, and establish a real ecosystem within 24 hours.

As the core developer of this protocol, I offer flexible, enterprise-grade software licenses tailored to your tokenomics and community scale.

## 🚀 Key Features & Modular Architecture (Devnet Verified)

The application utilizes an intelligent, built-in **Package Detection Engine** driven by URL parameters (`?pkg=...`). This allows you to pick, choose, and unlock specific modular layers according to your operational budget and community roadmap:

### 1. AMM DEX Swap (Anti-MEV Secure)
* **Live Price Feeds:** Automatically syncs real-time market rates every 30 seconds by leveraging Solana's premier liquidity aggregator (Jupiter API v2).
* **Jito MEV Shield:** Shields retail traders from malicious front-running and sandwich bots using simulated Jito private transaction bundles.
* **Anti-Wash Trading:** Embedded internal algorithms to track daily transaction cycles, protecting your charts from artificial volume manipulation.

### 2. Yield Optimizer Vaults
* **Auto-Compounding Logic:** Automated asset management protocol offering optimized daily yield simulations (up to 0.11% daily / 49.1% APY).
* **Global Trust & Social Proof:** Integrated real-time tracking of Global Vault TVL and Active Depositors counters to foster instant credibility.
* **Interactive Forecast Calculator:** An embedded projection panel (Daily, Monthly, Annual metrics) designed to gamify user interaction and incentivize long-term asset locking.

### 3. ZQI Lock & Yield Hub
* **Cryptographic Staking Epoch:** A secure on-chain locking mechanism for the custom native utility token **$ZQI** bound to a 7-day epoch horizon.
* **Real Yield Distribution:** Staking rewards are accrued and paid out in stablecoins (USDC), completely mitigating selling pressure on your primary project token.
* **Deflationary Burn Penalty:** Strict protocol enforcement where premature vault unlocks incur a mandatory 10% deflationary supply burn penalty.

### 4. Tiered On-Chain Affiliate (Referral System)
* **Sybil Attack Prevention:** Imposes a strict cooldown rate-limit (maximum 1 transaction per 10 seconds) to completely block multi-wallet bot manipulation.
* **Transparent Commissions Display:** Real-time calculation showing exact claimable USDC commission earnings alongside network volume.
* **Dynamic Tiering Matrix:** Automated commission tier calculation based on user referral trading volume:
    * **Bronze Tier:** Volume $0 - $10,000 ➜ 10% Commission
    * **Silver Tier:** Volume $10,001 - $100,000 ➜ 18% Commission
    * **Gold Tier:** Volume > $100,000 ➜ 25% Commission

## 🛠️ Deployment & White-Label Delivery

Upon purchase of a software license, I handle the execution and delivery process:

* **Frontend Customization:** I will fully rebrand the dApp with your token name, logos, custom tickers, color schemes, and official project links.
* **Domain Routing:** The functional dApp will be deployed to your custom domain or subdomain (e.g., `swap.yourtoken.com`).
* **Devnet Testing Environment:** By default, your preview build will be launched on **Solana Devnet** to ensure extensive bug-free validation without burning real SOL transaction fees.
* **Mainnet Switchover:** When you are ready to go live, the core network parameter can be migrated from `"devnet"` to `"mainnet-beta"` inside the configuration file with a single line change.
